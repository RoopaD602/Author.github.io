<p>Hi, I’m Radhika Mehta and I’m getting married this week.<br>
I work at Goldman Sachs, an investment bank. Thank you for reading my story. However, let me<br> warn you. You may not like much.<br>
One, I make a lot of money.<br>
Two, I have an opinion on everything.<br>
Three, I have had a boyfriend before. OK, maybe two.<br>
Now if I were a guy, you’d be cool with it. Since I am a girl, these things don’t make me likeable,<br> do they?<br>
From the author of blockbuster novels Five Point Someone, One Night @ the Call Center, The 3 <br>Mistakes of My Life, 2 States, and Revolution 2020 and Half Girlfriend comes a crazy story from <br>the point of view of a girl about love, dreams, career and feminism in modern India.</p>
