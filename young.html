<p>Why do our students regularly commit suicide?<br>
Why is there so much corruption in India?<br>
Cant our political parties ever work together?<br>
Does our vote make any difference at all?<br>
We love our India, but shouldnt some things be different?<br>
 <br>

All of us have asked these questions at some time or the other. So does Chetan Bhagat, Indias <br>most loved writer, in What Young India Wants, his first book of non-fiction.<br>
What Young India Wants is based on Chetan Bhagats vast experience as a very successful <br>writer and motivational speaker. In clear, simple prose, and with great insight, he analyses some <br>of the complex issues facing modern India, offers solutions and invites discussion on them. And, at the end, he asks this important <br>question: Unless we are all in agreement on what it is going to take to make our country better, how will things ever change<br>
If you want to understand contemporary India, the problems that face it, and want to be a part of the solution, What Young India Wants <br>is the book for you.</p>
